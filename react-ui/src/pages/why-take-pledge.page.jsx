			<h1>Why Take Pledge</h1>
			<p>I pledge to protect myself and everyone around me by staying home during this critical time. No exceptions. I pledge to never allow mine and othersâ€™ risk of infection, illness, hospitalization, critical care and death. I pledge this because I believe the more who adopt these actions will play an active role in minimizing the spread of COVID-19 to end the illness, anxiety and disruption it causes. I pledge to foster a sense of calm and control during these challenging times because we have the ability to actively slow the spread of this disease. I pledge to be an advocate for the cause, to lead by example and spread the message.</p>
